# Projects
This is the final project for the UBC course ECON323: Quantitative Economic Modelling with Data Science Applications with William Clinton Co, Diana Kaskeyeva and Janavi Nainani.

In this project we study the effects of mass shootings on tangential "shooting" related economies, in particular counter strike. 
The main question being "**does demand for shooting activities increase after a mass shooting**?"
